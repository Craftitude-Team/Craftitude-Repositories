+    Description: "This is it. IC\xB2, the future of IC.\nWhile playing it, you will
+      feel right at home again, rediscovering most of the stuff known from IC. However,
+      once you get your machines running, you will quickly notice how smooth and well-designed
+      everything works now. Wiring is easier, batterys aren't as twosided (on/off)
+      anymore, new cables, rubber stuff, new machines, EVERYTHING was added.\nCreate
+      obstacle courses of Metal Poles and Rubber-Sheets, explore the Nether with an
+      Electrical Jetpack or blow up whole landscapes at once by using the Dynamite-O-Mote.
+      Or discover the much more complex mechanisms of Nuclear Engineering, blow up
+      your hut or burn your hands. Or grap the rusty ol Composite Vest, and start
+      hunting Creepers with the new, allmighty NanoSaber.\n\nIt's up to you, it's
+      MINEcraft after all.\n"
