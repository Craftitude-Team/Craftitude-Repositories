Decompilation or reverse-engineering is strictly prohibited. All rights not explicitly granted are reserved.
        As a special exception, art assets (sprites, terrain textures) may be distributed intact or in modified form solely for the purpose of improving or altering the visible appearance of RedPower (ie as a "texture pack"). They may not be reused for any other purpose.
        A small number of textures incorporated into RedPower are based on originals created by Mojang AB. Since these make up an insubstantial portion of Minecraft and are largely transformed in original ways, and are used only for the purpose of aesthetic compatibility, these are deemed a "fair use" under copyright law. All other material is the sole and original creation of Eloraam.

    Name: "IndustrialCraft\xB2"
    Description: "This is it. IC\xB2, the future of IC.\nWhile playing it, you will
      feel right at home again, rediscovering most of the stuff known from IC. However,
      once you get your machines running, you will quickly notice how smooth and well-designed
      everything works now. Wiring is easier, batterys aren't as twosided (on/off)
      anymore, new cables, rubber stuff, new machines, EVERYTHING was added.\nCreate
      obstacle courses of Metal Poles and Rubber-Sheets, explore the Nether with an
      Electrical Jetpack or blow up whole landscapes at once by using the Dynamite-O-Mote.
      Or discover the much more complex mechanisms of Nuclear Engineering, blow up
      your hut or burn your hands. Or grap the rusty ol Composite Vest, and start
      hunting Creepers with the new, allmighty NanoSaber.\n\nIt's up to you, it's
      MINEcraft after all.\n"
